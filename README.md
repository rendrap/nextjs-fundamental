# The Beginner's Guide to Next.js

![Workshop cover](./workshop-cover.png)

## üëã Welcome

Welcome to The Beginner's Guide to Next.js [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) workshop! üöÄ

In this workshop we will discover the essential features of Next.js. Every exercise is an isolated mini project that focuses only on a specific feature, so you don't have anything extra to worry about. By the end of this workshop, you'll learn how to create Next.js projects, use Next.js's data fetching methods, create your own API handlers, use UI frameworks, and deploy your apps on Vercel.

I hope you like this workshop, and have fun learning ‚ù§Ô∏è

## ü§† Instructor

My name is Lazar Nikolov and I'm a developer / designer from Skopje, North Macedonia üá≤üá∞! I work at [CodeChem](https://codechem.com), I'm a core member at [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com), and I'm also an [egghead instructor](https://egghead.io/q/resources-by-lazar-nikolov).

My first interaction with programming was back in 2011, while I was still in high school. I was learning HTML and CSS on my own, sometimes during the classes (don't tell my teachers ü§´). Throughout my career I've been developing mobile apps, TV apps, desktop apps, but I've found my sweet spot as a Full-stack Engineer working with the React ecosystem.

I'm a super friendly guy, so if you have any questions, or just want to talk to me, the best place to reach me is on Twitter at [@NikolovLazar](https://twitter.com/NikolovLazar).

## üéØ Goal

After finishing this workshop, you'll become comfortable using Next.js to build your web apps and deploy them on Vercel.

## üöÖ Skills

You'll learn about web page rendering like SSR, SSG, which as a skill is completely transferrable in other frameworks and technologies.

If you haven't worked with TypeScript before, that's another skill that you'll learn and also apply in other frameworks and technologies.

We'll also going learn how to architecture our front-end using pages, layouts, and components, which is a skill you can apply in every front-end project in your future.

## üöß Prerequisites

Before starting this workshop, you should be comfortable working with React, TypeScript, and understand basic Web Dev concepts.

Here are some egghead.io courses that can bring you up to speed:
- [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) by Kent C. Dodds
- [React Context for State Management](https://egghead.io/courses/react-context-for-state-management) by Dave Ceddia
- [Shareable Custom Hooks in React](https://egghead.io/courses/shareable-custom-hooks-in-react) by Joe Previte
- [Up and Running with TypeScript](https://egghead.io/courses/up-and-running-with-typescript) by John Lindquist
- [Use Types Effectively in TypeScript](https://egghead.io/courses/use-types-effectively-in-typescript) by Ari Picker

## üíΩ Workshop Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your machine.

Each exercise is its own Next.js project and lives inside the `/exercises` folder. To get started, run `npm install` at the root (this installs all of the dependencies), `cd` into `exercises` and open the execise's README file (`exercises/exercise-01--create-a-new-next-js-type-script-project/README.md`), which contains the instructions. Each exercise can be run by running `npm run dev` at the root of the exercise.
